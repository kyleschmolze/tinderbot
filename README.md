tinderbot
=========

A dead simple auto-liking tinderbot, using the [tinder_pyro](https://github.com/nneal/tinder_pyro) gem. 
Yes, it's a rails project, not a gem. Because I know you're not actually trying to integrate anything, 
you're just getting some damn dates.

### Make it go
It's pretty simple, I wrote a script that gives you all of the instructions. Just do this to get it running.

1. Clone the repo with `git clone git@github.com:kyletns/tinderbot.git`
2. Enter the directory with `cd tinderbot`
3. Install the dependencies with `bundle install` (I hope you already have ruby).
4. Run a rails console with `rails console`
5. Run the bot with `Bot.go`
6. Follow the instructions

That's all she wrote!
